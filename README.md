# MassH0wl

MassH0wl is a lightweight Bash script that automates the use of wafw00f on a list of domains. It helps you quickly determine whether a target is protected by a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or not, and organizes the results for further analysis.

## Overview

The script processes a list of targets (IP addresses, domains, or subdomains) from an input file (`newdomains.txt`) and classifies each target based on the wafw00f output into one of the following categories:
- **With WAF:** Targets where a WAF is detected.
- **Without WAF:** Targets where no WAF is detected.
- **Down:** Targets that are unreachable or appear to be down.
- **WAF Details:** Detailed information about the detected WAF for further review.

## How It Works

1. **Input Handling:**  
   The script reads targets from `newdomains.txt`, ensuring that any Windows-style carriage returns are removed.

2. **Running wafw00f:**  
   For each target, the script runs the `wafw00f` command and captures its output.

3. **Output Analysis:**  
   - If the output includes the phrase `"appears to be down"`, the target is recorded in `down.txt`.
   - If the output contains a line starting with `[+] The site`, it indicates a WAF is present. The target is logged in `with_waf.txt`, and the script extracts the WAF nameâ€”saving this detail in `waf_details.txt`.
   - If the output mentions `"no waf detected"`, the target is saved in `without_waf.txt`.
   - If none of these conditions are met, the script treats the result as unclear and logs the target as down.

4. **Results Summary:**  
   After processing all targets, the script displays a summary of the results by indicating which files contain the targets with WAFs, without WAFs, detailed WAF information, or that are down.

## Prerequisites
- **wafw00f:** Ensure wafw00f is installed and available in your system's PATH.

## Setup and Usage

1. **Prepare the Input File:**
   - Create a file named `newdomains.txt` in the same directory as `massh0wl.sh`.
   - Add one target per line (e.g., domain, IP address, or subdomain).

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
   - Make the script executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x massh0wl.sh
     ```
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     ./massh0wl.sh
     ```

3. **Review the Results:**
   - `with_waf.txt` - Contains targets where a WAF is detected.
   - `without_waf.txt` - Contains targets where no WAF is detected.
   - `waf_details.txt` - Lists targets along with the detected WAF names.
   - `down.txt` - Contains targets that appear to be down or unreachable.

** To parse the output of 'waf_details.txt' into a CSV:
   - run this one-liner in the terminal:
     ```bash
     awk -F" : " '{gsub(/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m/,"",$2); print $1 "," $2}' waf_details.txt > waf_details.csv
     ```


## Ethical Considerations
